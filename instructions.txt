// create a method named GradeTestScores that takes an array of test scores as its parameter and returns a string
// GradeTestScores will add up these test scores and calculate an average score. 
// It should then return a message of "pass" or "fail" depending on these two conditions:
// If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and no single test score is below 50, then return a message of "pass".
// If the average score is lower than 70 or at least one test score is below 50, then return a message of "fail".
